# Data Structure Woodchipper

The goal of this mini project is to look at different data structures and how they can be 
- passed into a template, and
- decomposed 

within a Jinja2 Template.

The solara module is uses to present the information via a web interface which can be run locally 
on the student's laptop.

In the examples, all payload is loaded into a variable named `loaded_data`.
This variable in the pyhon script can be a 
- string variable
- a list
- a dictionary
- a complex data structure

The data_woodchipper.py App tests 

### Starting the App
Change into the 00_DataStructureChipper directory.
```bash
solara run data_woodchipper.py
```
